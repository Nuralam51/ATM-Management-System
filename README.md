Forking this repository</h2>
<p> Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for learn code or learn advance code in desktop app. The answer to that question is usually "yes", with attribution. There are some cases, such as using this code for a university project or something that is greater than a personal project, that I may be less comfortable saying yes to. If in doubt, please don't hesitate to ask me.

I value keeping this site open source, but as you all know, plagiarism is bad. I spent a non-negligible amount of effort developing, designing, and trying to perfect this iteration of this app, and I am proud of it! All I ask is to not claim this effort as your own.

So, feel free to fork this repository. If you do, please just give me proper credit by linking back to my website, https://nur-alam.tk. 

Thanks!</p>
